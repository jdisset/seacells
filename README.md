#Evolved Development Strategies of Artificial Multicellular Organisms
Light is present in the water, nutrients are in the ground, cells need to keep both their levels of light and nutrients above 0. They can share these 2 forms of energy. 

Organisms are evolved using a standard GA (https://github.com/jdisset/gaga). Simulations start with one single cell, its dna is an artificial gene regulatory network (https://github.com/jdisset/grgen). World and cells physics are simulated using a custom cellular physics model (https://github.com/jdisset/MecaCell).

Here are a few captures of some of the resulting organisms.
