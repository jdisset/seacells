#Evolved Development Strategies of Artificial Multicellular Organisms
Light is present in the water, nutrients are in the ground, cells need to keep both their levels of light and nutrients above 0. They can share these 2 forms of energy. 

Organisms are evolved using a standard GA (https://github.com/jdisset/gaga). Simulations start with one single cell, its dna is an artificial gene regulatory network (https://github.com/jdisset/grgen). World and cells physics are simulated using a custom cellular physics model (https://github.com/jdisset/MecaCell).

# Video captures
In the following video captures, the nutrients are represented as small spheres. Their colors indicate the available amount (green = full, red = empty), and the cells colors represent their level in light and nutrients.

## No novelty, survival only (local optima toward which 70% of the runs converged )

This repository will be regularly updated with new videos of organisms evolved in different world configurations.
